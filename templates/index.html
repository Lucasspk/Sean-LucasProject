      <h1>Project Purpose</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The overarching goal of this project is to provide a centralized repository of information surrounding the market and more technical information on computer hardware to help guide consumers toward the current best deals for building their own PCs or finding replacement parts.
      </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> Additionally, it will help inform consumers on the more technical aspects of each part in order to break down misleading advertising used by these massive hardware corporations. Finally, our project can aid consumers who arenâ€™t as picky in choosing last-generation components by helping them circumvent common scams on second-hand or shady online marketplaces.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Impact</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Our primary focus for the finished product is to create a well-optimized, aesthetic, and easily navigated website that is free to use and contains a plethora of helpful information for consumers in navigating the PC building market. Such data surrounding specific hardware capabilities/specs, availability, and consumer value will be included with updated market prices in addition to an algorithm that takes user preferences to recommend them a list of hardware components that will give them the best bang for their buck.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Ideally, we hope to benefit PC-building enthusiasts around the globe by accounting for odd price disparities in different regions. However, even for the non-hobbyists, one website with all of the information and tools they could possibly need to start their own build or swap out a faulty part would be incredibly beneficial. Even if we narrow down the scope of people we hope to impact through our project, specifically toward the GHS community, the project could definitely aid the outgoing seniors or any teen looking to get into the growing trend of high-performance gaming. In college, many majors such as engineering, data science, computer science, etc. require students to have higher processing power computers in order to effectively run graphically or computationally demanding programs and design software at a reasonable speed, but it is difficult for high school seniors, who may not be as enthusiastic about the newest computer technology as us, to differentiate effective products due to misleading advertising and dodgy product naming schemes. Additionally, we plan on incorporating our knowledge in economics and current world news in order to adequately explain to increasingly worried, market-aware consumers why component prices have been on the rise but why the near future for the industry looks optimistic. Overall, our goal to create a free consolidated digital guide to the computer market is to hopefully help anybody, regardless of their level of prior information, make smart financial decisions when choosing PC parts.
